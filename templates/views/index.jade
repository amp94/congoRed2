				| "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that a pregnant woman might 
				| develop during her pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood pressure in woman 
				| who had not previously experienced high blood pressure before and includes signs 
				| of damage to another organ system. If left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to 
				| eclampsia, a serious condition that can put a mother and her baby at risk, and in
				| rare cases, cause death." [1]

				| "Aberrant protein misfolding and aggregation are two recently discovered 
				| molecular signatures of preeclampsia. Congo Red dye adheres to misfolded urinary 
				| proteins of preeclamptic women, a characteristic known as congophilia. This has led 
				| to the development of the Congo Red Dot Test (CRD) Quantkit, which can provide an 
				| unbiased and accurate diagnostic test for it." [2]
